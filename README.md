# credit-risk-prediction
Developed a predictive model to assess credit risk and predict the likelihood of loan default.
. Utilized machine learning techniques to analyse historical lending data and identify factors contributing to
credit risk.
. Achieved 95% accuracy in predicting credit risk, assisting in informed decision-making for loan approval.
This project has potential to contribute to the improvement of risk management strategies and the
reduction of loan default rates.
This project aims to predict the credit risk of loan applicants using machine learning techniques. The system classifies applicants into different risk categories to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.
